            This clone was selected for full length sequencing because it
            passed the following selection criteria: matched mRNA gi: 4557712
            This clone has the following problem: no 5' EST match.
            
            Differences found between this sequence and the human reference
            genome (build 36) are described in misc_difference features below
            and these differences were also compared to chimpanzee genome
            (build 2).
